renumberPDB
===========

This is a nice little script that I wrote to change the atom and residue numbers in structural .pdb files.

Usage: ./renumberPDB.py structure.pdb > renumbered_structure.pdb

where structure.pdb is the name of the structural file in which to carry out the renumbering, and renumbered_structure.pdb is the name of the file in which to write the resulting structure.
